Often students are left underexposed to the discipline because of a hesitation to add to an already full course syllabus or because of the lack of a clear connection between standard class material and research-grade quantum chemical software. Here we present a laboratory exercise in which students use standard second-year concepts such as the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator approximations in conjunction with Gaussian 03 to enforce practical concepts in computational chemistry. Such concepts include the compromise between accuracy and computational time as well as the limitations of a non-correlated approach to certain molecular properties.

The influence of ylide stabilization and the nature of phosphorus substituents on reversibility of oxaphosphetane formation is clarified. Unexpectedly, the puckering ability of addition TSs is shown not to depend on ylide stabilization, but the geometry of the TS is decided by an interplay of 1,2; 1,3; and C−H ...

In general, the run time of the Cinfony modules is almost as fast as accessing the underlying toolkits directly from C++ or Java, but Cinfony makes it much easier to carry out common tasks in cheminformatics such as reading file formats and calculating descriptors.

Among its new features are an improved method for handling different styles of type, and commands for including graphics and producing colors. LaTex 2[subscript epsilon] makes available to all LaTex users valuable enhancements to the software that have been developed over the years by users in many different places to satisfy a variety of needs. This book, written by the original architect and implementer of LaTex is both the user's guide and the reference manual for the software. It has been updated to reflect the changes in the new release. The book begins with instructions for formatting simpler text, and progressively describes commands and techniques for handling larger and more complicated documents. A separate chapter explains how to deal with errors. An added appendix describes what is new and different in LaTex 2[subscript epsilon]. Other additions to the second edition include descriptions of new commands for inserting pictures prepared with other programs and for producing colored output; new sections on how to make books and slides; instructions for making an index with the MakeIndex program, and an updated guide to preparing a bibliography with the BibTex program; plus a section on how to send your LaTex documents electronically. Users new to LaTex will find here a book that has earned worldwide praise as a model for clear, concise, and practical documentation. Experienced users will want to update their LaTex library. Although most standard LaTex input files will work with LaTex 2[subscript epsilon], to take advantage of the new features, a few LaTex 2[subscript epsilon] conventions must first be learned. For users who want an advanced guide to LaTex 2[subscript epsilon] and to more than 150 packages that can now be used at any site to provide additional features, a useful companion to this book is The LaTex Companion, by Goossens, Mittelbach, and Samarin (also published by Addison-Wesley). LaTex is a software system for typesetting documents. Because it is especially good for technical documents and is available for almost any computer system, LaTex has become a lingua franca of the scientific world. Researchers, educators, and students in universities, as well as scientists in industry, use LaTex to produce professionally formatted papers, proposals, and books. They also use LaTex input to communicate information electronically to their colleagues around the world. 1. Getting Acquainted -- 2. Getting Started -- 3. Carrying On -- 4.

A series of computer laboratories is described to introduce undergraduate students to commonly adopted in silico drug design methods, such as molecular geometry optimization, pharmacophore modeling, protein–ligand docking simulations, homology modeling, virtual screening, and pharmacokinetics/toxicity predictions. Freely available software and web servers are selected to compose this pedagogical resource, such that it can be easily implemented in any institution equipped with an Internet connection and Windows OS computers. This material is an illustration of a drug discovery pipeline, starting from the structure of known drugs to obtain novel bioactive compounds, and, therefore, is a valid pedagogical instrument for educating future professionals in the field of drug development.",

A step-by-step practical tutorial with plenty of examples on research-based problems from various areas of science, that prove how simple, yet effective, it is to provide solutions based on SciPy. This book is targeted at anyone with basic knowledge of Python, a somewhat advanced command of mathematics/physics, and an interest in engineering or scientific applications--this is broadly what we refer to as scientific computing. This book will be of critical importance to programmers and scientists who have basic Python knowledge and would like to be able to do scientific and numerical computations with SciPy.
